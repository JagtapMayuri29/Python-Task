    "### Easy to Learn and Use\n",
    "_Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-platform\n",
    "_Python can run on many operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressive Language\n",
    "_Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print(\"Hello World\"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted Language\n",
    "_Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-platform Language\n",
    "_Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Language\n",
    "_Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensible\n",
    "_It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Standard Library\n",
    "_It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development._\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI support\n",
    "_Python supports graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which are used to develop desktop applications_\n"
